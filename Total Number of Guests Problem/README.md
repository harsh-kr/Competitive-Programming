# Total Number of Guests Problem
A person hosts a party and invites N guests to it. However, each guest has a condition, that each guest only stays at the party if
there are at least ‘Pi’ people already at the party, otherwise leaves. The total number of guests N and the number of people each guest
needs ‘Pi’ are given as input for each guest. The task is to find the total guests that are present at the party. It is also given that
the guests arrive at the party in the order given in the array ‘Pi’.
