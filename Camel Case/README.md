# Camel Case

Alice wrote a sequence of words in CamelCase as a string of letters, s, having the following properties:

* It is a concatenation of one or more words consisting of English letters.
* All letters in the first word are lowercase.
* For each of the subsequent words, the first letter is uppercase and rest of the letters are lowercase.

Given s, print the number of words in s on a new line.

For example, s=oneTwoThree. There are 3 words in the string.
