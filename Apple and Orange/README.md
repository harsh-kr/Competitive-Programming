# Apple and Orange Problem

Sam's house has an apple tree and an orange tree that yield an abundance of fruit. Using the information given below, determine the number of apples and oranges
that land on Sam's house.
<br/>
* s is the start point, and t is the endpoint. The apple tree is to the left of the house, and the orange tree is to its right.<br/>
* Assume the trees are located on a single point, where the apple tree is at a point , and the orange tree is at b point . <br/>
* When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands d units of distance from its tree of origin along the -axis. *A negative value of d means the fruit fell  units to the
tree's left, and a positive value of d means it falls d units to the tree's right. *
<br/>
Given the value of  for m apples and n oranges, we have to determine how many apples and oranges will fall on Sam's house (i.e., in the inclusive range [s,t] ).
<br/><br/>
The function countApplesAndOranges has the following parameter(s):<br/>

* s: integer, starting point of Sam's house location.<br/>
* t: integer, ending location of Sam's house location.<br/>
* a: integer, location of the Apple tree.<br/>
* b: integer, location of the Orange tree.<br/>
* apples: integer array, distances at which each apple falls from the tree.<br/>
* oranges: integer array, distances at which each orange falls from the tree.<br/>
