# Flesch Index
The Flesch Reading Ease score is a tool for calculating the approximate reading level of English-language content, relying on the structure
of the English language to provide an accurate result. Sentence length and the length of the words within the sentence are both taken into
consideration when calculating the Flesch readability score.<br>
Short sentences and small words receive a higher score, while long sentences with longer words receive lower scores. Typically, a score of
90 to 100 means that the content is very simple and easy to read. A score of 60-70 means that your content is perfect for intermediate
readers at or above an 8th or 9th-grade reading level, and a score of 0-30 is more suited for university work than for the internet.

In the Flesch reading-ease test, higher scores indicate material that is easier to read; lower numbers mark passages that are more
difficult to read. The formula for the Flesch reading-ease score (FRES) test is

| Score  | Level  | Notes  |

| 90.0-80.0  | 6th grade  | Easy to read. Conversational English for consumers.  |
| 80.0-70.0  | 7th grade  | Fairly easy to read.  |
| 70.0-60.0  | 8th & 9th grade  | Plain English. Easily understood by 13- to 15-year-old students.  |

Reader's Digest magazine has a readability index of about 65, Time magazine scores about 52, an average grade six student's written 
assignment (age of 12) has a readability index of 60–70 (and a reading grade level of six to seven), and the Harvard Law Review has a
general readability score in the low 30s. The highest (easiest) readability score possible is 121.22, but only if every sentence consists
of only one one-syllable word. "The cat sat on the mat." scores 116. The score does not have a theoretical lower bound; therefore,
it is possible to make the score as low as wanted by arbitrarily including words with many syllables.
The sentence "This sentence, taken as a reading passage unto itself, is being used to prove a point." has a readability of 74.1.
The sentence "The Australian platypus is seemingly a hybrid of a mammal and reptilian creature." scores 37.5 as it has 24 syllables
and 13 words. While Amazon calculates the text of Moby Dick as 57.9, one particularly long sentence about sharks in chapter 64 has
a readability score of −146.77. One sentence in the beginning of Swann's Way, by Marcel Proust, has a score of −515.1.
