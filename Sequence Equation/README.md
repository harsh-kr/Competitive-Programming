# Sequence Equation

Given a sequence of n integers,p(1),p(2),...,p(n) where each element is distinct and satisfies 1<=p(x)<=n. For each x where 1<=x<=n, find any integer y such that p(p(y))=x and 
print the value of y on a new line.

permutationEquation has the following parameter(s):

* p: an array of integers
