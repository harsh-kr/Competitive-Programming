# Grading Students

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

* Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
* Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:

* If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
* If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's  students, need to write code to automate the rounding process.

The function gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):

* int grades[n]: the grades before rounding

and returns

* int[n]: the grades after rounding as appropriate
